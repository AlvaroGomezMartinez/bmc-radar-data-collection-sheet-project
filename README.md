# BMC Radar Data Collection Sheet Project<br>
## [Northside Independent School District](https://www.nisd.net/)
### Departments of [Special Education](https://www.nisd.net/district/special-education) and [Academic Technology](https://www.nisd.net/district/teaching-learning/academic-technology)
#### <b>Project Lead:</b> Clara Boling, Special Education Area Coordinator<br><b>Google Apps Script (GAS) Development:</b> [Alvaro Gomez](mailto:alvaro.gomez@nisd.net), Academic Technology Coach
<b>Objective:</b> Create a data collection sheet that will be used for placement decision making by stakeholders.<br>
<b>Concept:</b> A GAS bound to a Google Spreadsheet automates the creation of weekly data collection sheets and consolidates the data into a summary sheet. The weekly sheet template is organized in a way that, for the initial setup, the teacher adds the student's daily schedule. Formulas bring in the information to cells that organize the data throughout the week. Once the the schedule is set up, the teacher clicks on a menu called, "Data Collection Information" then "Create Weekly Sheets". The teacher will be prompted for the day they will start collecting data and how many weeks they would like to create. The GAS will duplicate the weekly sheets and insert the references to the weekly data into the Summary sheet. The teacher then inserts the data throughout the day.<br>
TODO: Add the setup steps for teachers.
