#### <b>Project Lead:</b> Clara Boling, Special Education Area Coordinator<br><b>Google Apps Script (GAS) Development:</b> [Alvaro Gomez](mailto:alvaro.gomez@nisd.net), Academic Technology Coach
<b>Purpose:</b> Develop a data collection system for students who need intensive behavior support through the Behavior Mastery Center.<br>
<b>Concept:</b> Create a GAS bound to a Google Spreadsheet that automates the creation of weekly data collection sheets and consolidates the data into a summary sheet. The weekly sheet template is organized in a way that the teacher adds the student's daily schedule and formulas bring in the information to cells that organize the data throughout the week.
